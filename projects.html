                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            I joined Triton UAS in the fall quarter of my freshman year. By the summer of my sophomore year, I had become
                            one of two leads of the software subteam. This means that I was (and currently still am) responsible for all 
                            of the software in our plane that contributes to competing in the AUVSI SUAS competition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Essentially, the competition requires us to build a plane that can autonomously fly a mission. The mission includes
                            waypoints, a search area, and drop targets. The plane must be able to navigate through the waypoints, cover the search
                            area while taking pictures and identifying targets, and drop a specific payload on a corresponding target that we identify.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            The frontend of our ground control station is a web app that allows us to monitor the status of the plane while
                            in flight and change any parameters we need to. It is currently built in Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML, but we plan to migrate it to
                            a framework in the future to make it easier to develop. It
