                        This page is an overview of all of the most relevant projects I've worked on. I have divided them into three categories:
                        <span class="highlight">Triton UAS</span>, <span class="highlight">Personal</span>, and <span class="highlight">School</span>.

                        The <span class="highlight">Triton UAS</span> section contains all of the projects I've worked on in my time as a part
                        of the club. The <span class="highlight">Personal</span> section contains all of the projects I've worked on in my free time.
                        And lastly, the <span class="highlight">School</span> section contains all of the projects I've worked on as assignments
                        for classes.

                        expand out a list of all the projects that have that keyword, and from there clicking on a project will take you to 
                        a page with more information about that project.

                            <p>
                                I joined <span class="highlight">Triton UAS</span> in the fall quarter of my freshman year. By the summer of my sophomore year, I had become
                                one of two leads of the software subteam. This means that I was (and currently still am) responsible for all 
                                of the software in our plane that contributes to competing in the <span class="highlight">AUVSI SUAS competition.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Essentially, the competition requires us to build a plane that can autonomously fly a mission. The mission includes
                                <span class="highlight">waypoints</span>, a <span class="highlight">search area</span>, and <span class="highlight">drop targets.</span> 
                                The plane must be able to navigate through the waypoints, cover the search
                                area while taking pictures and identifying targets, and drop a specific payload on a corresponding target that we identify.

                                The most impactful project I have been involved with as a part of TUAS has been the porting of our onboard computer
                                program from Python to C++. The onboard computer is responsible for all of the second-to-second operations of the plane,
                                such as path planning, mission management, camera controls, computer vision, and communicating with both the ground and
                                other components on the plane itself, such as the airdrop payloads and the flight controller.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The structure of this codebase is something I helped design and am very proud of. Essentially, the whole program is modelled as a
                                state machine, where each different "state" of the mission can be modeled as a "Tick": a piece of code that runs at a specified interval.
                                This makes the codebase very modular, because modifying the flow of the autonomous mission is as easy as "rewriring" how ticks
                                transition to each other, or adding new ticks to define new behaviors.
                            </p>

                                in flight. It also allows provides the interface to input the mission parameters, like waypoints, and upload
                                them to the plane.

                                The backend of our ground control station, dubbed <span class="highlight">Hub</span>, is a REST API that allows us to
                                communicate with the plane while in flight. It is currently built in <span class="highlight">Go</span> and runs in a
                                <span class="highlight">Docker</span> container on an <span class="highlight">Intel NUC</span> on the ground. It receives
                                basic telemetry data from the plane via a radio connection. It sends this telemetry to our antenna tracker which points
                                a directional wifi antenna at the plane. With this connection, the GCS can send HTTP requests to the onboard computer
                                on the plane to request data relevant to the competition mission.

                                In order to plan the static path that the plane will take through the competition waypoints, we developed a system
                                that utilizes an RRT* algorithm for path planning. I developed the original implementation of this algorithm in Python,
                                which has since been converted to C++ (and greatly improved!)

                                This website itself is a project that I've been developing for a while, if not entirely in this form. It originated
                                from a class I took: <span class="highlight">CSE 134B: Web Client Technologies</span>. This class taught the foundations
                                of HTML, CSS, Javascript, HTTP, and other frontend web technologies. Each assignment built on the previous as we slowly
                                built up a resume website. This current iteration is the culmination of all of that work, and I plan to continue to
                                maintain this website as a benchmark for myself to see how much I have improved.

                                UCSD's CSE 110 course is a class that teaches the fundamentals of software engineering. This involves agile
                                development, design patterns, git, and working in small teams (of six, for this specific version of the
                                course). Specifically, we applied these skills while constructing an Android Application titled Birds of a
                                Feather. This application allowed users to create a profile which included their name, major, and
                                UCSD courses taken. Then, they could press a button to activate bluetooth and exchange information with
                                nearby students (for example, in the context of a lecture hall). It would then match students based on their
                                previous courses, and allow simple preformatted messages to be sent demonstrating a desire to form a group or
                                get to know each other.

                                As a part of a course on compilers, throughout the quarter we slowly built up a compiler for a toy
                                language called "snek" with syntax based on s-expressions. Major compiler features included
                                arithmetic operations, let bindings, if statements, loops, function calls, 
                                tuples/vectors/dynamically allocated data structures, garbage collection,
                                and basic optimizations such as inlining, constant folding and propogation, and 
                                dead code elimination.

                                As a part of a course on working with large codebases, we developed extensions
                                to CPython's idle application: a lightweight python IDE that comes prepackaged
                                with Python. In my group of three people we added functionality that allows the
                                user to interface with various Open AI models from within the editor.
