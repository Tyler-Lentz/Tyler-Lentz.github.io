        <h1>My Recommendations For New Fantasy/Sci-Fi Readers (2024)</h1>
        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>
            I've gotten somewhat of a reputation among my friend group throughout the last couple of years
            of being a pretty big reader, and with that I've gotten a number of my friends asking me for
            book recommendations, which is super awesome! It's always amazing when a friend reads the same
            book as you or watches the same show and then you can talk about all the things you both loved.
            It's especially cool, however, when the series is still ongoing, because then you can both
            speculate together about how you think everything will go down.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently, one of my friends finished the first series I recommended to him, and was
            hungry for more recommendations. This motivated me to put together a mega-document for him that
            listed out all of my top series and explained what they were about and how much of a commitment
            they would be. Before I knew it I had spent over three hours on a Sunday afternoon compiling this
            document for him, when I realized that it would be a really good thing to post here, so here it is!
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a slightly edited and more generalized version of that recommendation document. This is both
            for people who might ask me for recommendations in the future, and also for myself as I hope to make
            one of these each year so I can see the progression of my taste over time.
        </p>

        <h2>"The" Document</h2>
        <p>
            All of these are series that I really, really enjoy. 
            They aren't listed in any particular order, other than being grouped by certain elements.
            At the end, however, I include a highly volatile ranking of my general preferences, which is 
            less indicative of my preferences and more-so varies as the months go by. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this document I have two main classes of series, the "Sprawling" Epics and "Generational" Epics. Note that these are both "Epics", and tend to be series on the longer side. This is a side effect of my taste (that I like longer series), and while there are some standalone books I enjoy greatly the bulk of my recommendations come from these categories. There are, however, variety among these series in their length and difficulty of entry.
        </p>
        <h3>A Note on the <span class="cosmere">Cosmere</span></h3>
        <p>
            It's impossible to talk about my taste in Fantasy without talking about the Cosmere. Brandon Sanderson is the author
            that first got me into Fantasy with <i>Mistborn</i>, and I have a great fondness for all of his work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Cosmere is the brainchild of Brandon Sanderson, probably one of the most popular authors in contemporary fantasy. The easiest way to explain it goes like this: imagine if the MCU was planned out by one person who had total creative freedom over every aspect of his universe, and the time and resources to see it through (the first Cosmere book was published in 2005, and Sanderson will likely not finish for another 20-30+ years based on his current plans). There are countless series which are all set inside of the Cosmere, but seem entirely unrelated. You can read each of these series on their own and get the full enjoyment out of them, but then if you start to read across different series within the Cosmere you will start to see hints at the shared background between all of these stories, and how they all connect. As the Cosmere has continued to advance, there have been more and more connections between the books.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to go down the Cosmere rabbit hole—and it is a good rabbit hole to go down, but not the only one—the best way would be to pick one of the “Big Two”: Mistborn or the Stormlight Archive, and then read that to completion. If you still want to continue with Sanderson and the Cosmere, then you can start jumping around to the various series, and you can probably find online one-thousand different reading guides and varying opinions about how to experience it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brandon Sanderson excels at creative worldbuilding and interesting magic systems. Many people criticize his prose and/or characters, but that is more-so a symptom of how popular he is—because he is so popular, he is exposed to more people, and more people feel motivated to critique it to justify why they don’t “get” the hype. That isn’t to say that these elements of his books aren’t on the weaker side, but at the end of the day it is a matter of preference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I think Sanderson’s stories are incredibly thrilling, and I don’t think there is a single one which has a bad ending. In fact, Sanderson EXCELS at good endings. There is even a term among his fans, the “Sanderlanche,” referring to how all of his books end in an avalanche of action and excitement, where things he has been setting up for 1, 2, 3… books finally all come together. As I’ve read more authors, I’ve noticed that his characters and dialogue might not be up to speed with authors who really excel at those aspects, but by no means are they bad, and I still really like a lot of his characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do jump into the Cosmere, then you likely will spend the next 20-30 years of your life eagerly awaiting the next installment in the series, which is kind of cool to think about and very humbling. It might seem overwhelming right now, but it will be even more overwhelming in a decade or two as he only continues to write more and more books!
        </p>
        <p>
            The main reason to not read the Cosmere would be if you are intimidated by feeling obligated to read everything, or if another one of these series that is not in the Cosmere really catches your eye. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This section isn’t a particular endorsement of the Cosmere above any of the other series listed here as they are all amazing, but more an explanation of how certain series within these broader categories are actually related in their own way, all being in the same extended universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, I’ve highlighted the title of any series or book that is a part of the Cosmere in blue so you can easily pick them out.
        </p>

        <h3>The Sprawling Epics</h3>
        <p>
            The Sprawling epics are series that feel big. They are absolute behemoths of literature, and will likely take you months if not years (for some) to finish. These all have incredibly well-developed world building, complex characters that you will become best friends with, and just generally are awe inspiring. These are the kinds of stories that if you finish you can’t help but carry with you for the rest of your life.
        </p>
        <p>
            They also pose a lot of investment. Note in the preceding statement “if you finish.” Most people can tell within the first 1-3 books whether they will like a series or not, but oftentimes people will stick it out even if they don’t really enjoy it because people always say “it gets better around book X!” The funny thing is that this is usually true. Series like this do tend to get better and better as you get further, not only because the writing and characters get more developed, but because you are more in-tune with the world building and what is going on. It takes less exposition to get you up to speed, and you are already invested in the stakes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to undertake one of these sprawling epics, then even though they do almost always get better as they go on, the key thing to understand is that this only really applies to a certain kind of person: namely one who already liked the first couple of books, and is interested to see where things go. If you are completely bored/not interested in the beginning, then it is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will continue to feel that way.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of that is a long way to say that these are big investments with big rewards, but don’t fall victim to sunk-cost fallacy even if it is true they get better as they go on. And of course, if you like one of these series right off the bat (all of these listed I personally did) then you know you are going to be set on content for a long time.
        </p>

Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time is a story that takes place both in our past and our future. In his fantasy world, only women can use the One Power safely. Any man who wields will inevitably go insane and wreak havoc in the world.

As the books begin, the Dark One, the embodiment of pure evil, is breaking free from his prison. The overall plot is about a man who learns that he is the reincarnation of the world's messiah and is once again destined to save the world from the Dark One -- but possibly destroy it in the process. This saga is not only his story, but the story of an entire world's struggle to deal with war and change, destruction and hope.

May the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.

        <h5>The Pitch</h5>
        <p>
            The Wheel of Time is the ultimate post-Tolkien classic high fantasy hero’s journey centered around a chosen one with a large destiny who comes from a humble village in the middle of nowhere. This story hits all of the right beats that you would expect from a story like this, and it does it extremely well.
        </p>
        <p>
            But where it diverges and becomes solely unique is in the scope of its storytelling. The story doesn’t just follow the chosen one, although the first book mainly does. It also has a continent-spanning cast of interesting and diverse characters all with their own allegiances, goals, and experiences. The story essentially spends 10/11 books growing larger and larger and more complex with more and more characters and POVs and conflicts and goals, all looming closer and closer towards “The Final Battle”, or Tarmon Gai'don in the old tongue, with the Dark One—the essential embodiment of evil in this world, and then the final 3/4 books are a masterclass in payoff that perfectly cap off the series.
        </p>
        <p>
            The great thing about the Wheel of Time, in my opinion, is this diversity in conflicts. There of course is the central conflict against the Dark One, but there are also much more down-to-earth conflicts, like political struggles, interpersonal conflicts, and the likes. There are so many characters and arcs it would be impossible to list them all out here.

“A Song of Ice and Fire takes place in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. The Targaryens ruled for three hundred years, continuing beyond the extinction of the dragons. Their dynasty eventually ended with a rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon, in which Aerys II "the Mad King" Targaryen was killed and Robert proclaimed king of the Seven Kingdoms. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 years have passed since Robert's rebellion, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.”

        <h5>The Pitch</h5>
        <p>
        There is a reason <i>Game of Thrones</i> was one of the most popular TV shows of all time, and a reason why it went to crap after the show writers no longer had book content to base their plot off of. Nobody does characters or political machinations better than George R. R. Martin, and nobody else writes their stories with as many complex, interweaved layers. Within the first 100 pages you will understand why this is one of the most popular series ever, not even just in Fantasy.
        </p>
        <h5>The Warning</h5>
        <p>
        A Song of Ice and Fire is famously unfinished, with George R. R. Martin working on the 6th installment ever since 2011, and a 7th planned if he lives long enough. It is incredibly dubious if this will happen, however, and many fans have made their peace that they won't get a conclusion other than the show ending, which was unsatisfactory.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, the fact that even in spite of all of this the series is still regarded as one of the best of all time, and that I’m including it here, says a lot. I genuinely think this is one of the best series ever, only held back by the drama around whether or not it will be finished.

Hadrian Marlowe, a man revered as a hero and despised as a murderer, chronicles his tale in the galaxy-spanning debut of the Sun Eater series, merging the best of space opera and epic fantasy.

It was not his war.

On the wrong planet, at the right time, for the best reasons, Hadrian Marlowe started down a path that could only end in fire. The galaxy remembers him as a hero: the man who burned every last alien Cielcin from the sky. They remember him as a monster: the devil who destroyed a sun, casually annihilating four billion human lives—even the Emperor himself—against Imperial orders.

But Hadrian was not a hero. He was not a monster. He was not even a soldier.

Fleeing his father and a future as a torturer, Hadrian finds himself stranded on a strange, backwater world. Forced to fight as a gladiator and navigate the intrigues of a foreign planetary court, he will find himself fighting a war he did not start, for an Empire he does not love, against an enemy he will never understand.

        <h5>The Pitch</h5>
        <p>
            With the intimacy of a confessional, the scope of an opera, and a world heavily inspired by Dune, Sun Eater is clearly inspired but still ends up being something truly unique. Described by the author as “What if Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader is the right thing,” it is the chronicled tale of Hadrian Marlowe, a famous figure who has lived for thousands of years in a far future where humanity spans millions of stars across the Milky Way Galaxy. Reaching the end of his long-lived and horror-filled life, he has sat down and begun to recount his life story. Thus begins the series, told in his own voice chronicling how he went from the first sun of a relatively obscure planetary lord to the most infamous man in the history of mankind—the man who single handedly ended the war against the alien Cielcin by destroying a single star.
        </p>
        <p>
            The really interesting thing is that although as the reader you sympathize with Hadrian, you often find yourself disagreeing with him and the values of the society in which he lives. It does not at all feel like 2024 copy pasted into the future. It is a really complex tale spanning thousands of years, and the final volume is personally one of my most anticipated releases, as the 6th book came out very recently and it is fresh on my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you liked Dune, you will probably like this as well. The world building is heavily inspired, but not derivative, and fills a similar itch while not being as hard to read or understand.

        <blockquote class="breakout full-width">
Widely acclaimed for his work completing Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time saga, Brandon Sanderson now begins a grand cycle of his own, one every bit as ambitious and immersive.

Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.

It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.

One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.

Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by overpowering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.

Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under the eminent scholar and notorious heretic Jasnah Kholin, Dalinar’s niece. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan’s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

The result of more than ten years of planning, writing, and worldbuilding, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.

Speak again the ancient oaths,

LIFE BEFORE DEATH.
STRENGTH BEFORE WEAKNESS.
JOURNEY BEFORE DESTINATION.

and return to men the Shards they once bore.
The Knights Radiant must stand again.

        <h5>The Pitch</h5>
        <p>
        	The back of the book blurb itself is honestly better than anything I can think of right now. The series is classic High fantasy but in an entirely original world unlike any other fantasy world I’ve seen. And it has Cosmere connections, so if you get into the Cosmere those become incredibly interesting as you start to notice recurring characters from other series and the likes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most notable thing about Roshar (the world upon which the series takes place) is the storms. Weather dominates life on Roshar, and seeing a fully fledged society entirely built around dealing with these harsh conditions is incredibly interesting. Throw in a classic Brando-Sando magic system, great plot, unexpected twists, and you're set for an amazing series.
        </p>

        <h3>The Generational Epics</h3>
        <p>
            What I’ve classified as Generational Epics are series which are still epic in scope, but split amongst different “generations” of subseries that all take place in the same world, but each stand on their own. These still provide a lot of the same scope as the Sprawling Epics, but have more breaks amongst the individual series that compose them. Some of these follow the same main characters but later in their lives, while others only have minimal crossover in characters but it is the world which continues on and evolves

In a faraway land where members of the royal family are named for the virtues they embody, one young boy will become a walking enigma.

Born on the wrong side of the sheets, Fitz, son of Chivalry Farseer, is a royal bastard, cast out into the world, friendless and lonely. Only his magical link with animals - the old art known as the Wit - gives him solace and companionship. But the Wit, if used too often, is a perilous magic, and one abhorred by the nobility.

So when Fitz is finally adopted into the royal household, he must give up his old ways and embrace a new life of weaponry, scribing, courtly manners; and how to kill a man secretly, as he trains to become a royal assassin.

        <h5>The Pitch</h5>	
        <p>
            The Realm of the Elderlings at its soul is the story of FitzChivalry Farseer, a bastard child of the Royal Family of the Six Duchies who is secretly trained to be an Assassin. The series as a whole follows his life, and the bulk of it is told in his first-person voice. The story is incredibly intimate, as you get to know every fiber of Fitz’s being and you go through all of his triumphs and struggles with him. There are various conflicts and political intrigues that come about, which is the bulk of the plot, but really these books are incredibly character focused and character driven. Robin Hobb excels at writing characters in a similar way to George R. R. Martin and Joe Abercrombie.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I mentioned above in the chart that this series is split into 5 subseries, 4 trilogies and one quartet. The first, third, and final trilogies are all Fitz stories, and are told from his perspective. The second and fourth cover different characters in a different region in the world, and have (at first) minimal crossover with the events of the Fitz series. However, by the final Fitz trilogy everything comes together in an incredible crossover which was 20+ years in the making. I’m getting chills thinking about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you really like well-written characters, and enjoy when authors just give page time to let their characters breathe and talk to each other, then these books are for you. Also, if you like watching characters go through incredible hardships, then this is also for you, because let’s just say that Robin Hobb is NOT kind to her characters. But in a way that is great for an author because the stories are incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you read these books, you will genuinely feel a close connection with Fitz and you will feel like you’ve seen his entire life story. And if you do decide to not skip the non-Fitz series (which you technically could, though I wouldn’t recommend it) they are incredible series in their own right. The second series, namely, is called the Liveship Traders series, and has to deal with traders, pirates, and magical ships who come to life and live alongside their crew. It is also a masterpiece on the same level as the rest of Hobb’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a side note, as this is a generational series, you can stop after any series and you will feel like you have had a satisfying conclusion.

            What would you get if you cross The Hunger Games, Brave New World, A Song of Ice and Fire, and Space? You would get Red Rising. Red Rising is an incredibly fast paced, action packed thrilling series following Darrow of Lykos as he (a Red, the lowest caste) goes undercover as a Gold (the highest caste) and attempts to instigate a revolution to bring down the tyrannical solar-system-wide spanning government.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Robin Hobb excels at letting her characters just talk and breath, Red Rising, is the exact opposite. It is nonstop crazy action and plot twists. This isn’t to say that the characters are bad—they are not—but that just that the books are more plot-driven than character-driven.
        </p>

            I don’t know if there really are any characters in this series that you can consider “Good.” They range from morally bankrupt to tolerable. But they are all incredibly interesting and you still enjoy reading about them and even sympathize with them. It is a cutthroat world, kind of similar to A Song of Ice and Fire, but not entirely. There are schemes and plotting and wars and ancient conflicts and it all slowly builds up and explodes into an incredibly interesting and surprisingly funny story.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would like to emphasize that. People often call this series "Grimdark", but if you went into it thinking that you would
            be surprised by how funny certain characters can be! Of course it is a very harsh world with harsh people doing bad things,
            but that is what makes the moments of humor and humility all the more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 3 subseries. The first is just called The First Law Trilogy, starting with The Blade Itself, and it is where you should start. Then, there is a series of 3 standalone books which follow different characters in different parts of the world which bridge the gap between the first trilogy and the second, which is called the Age of Madness Trilogy. All of them are really good, and I think the first book The Blade Itself is probably the weakest of the 9, so if you like it a bit but wish there was a little more action or excitement then don’t worry.

What if the whole world were a dead, blasted wasteland?

For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the "Sliver of Infinity," reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier "snapped" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.

Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.

But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.

Brandon Sanderson, fantasy's newest master tale-spinner and author of the acclaimed debut Elantris, dares to turn a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the prophesied hero failed to defeat the Dark Lord? The answer will be found in the Mistborn Trilogy, a saga of surprises that begins with the book in your hands. Fantasy will never be the same again.

            It has 3 of my favorite magic systems all in one book, and the ending of era 1 is probably the best ending of <i>any</i> series
            I have ever read. The amount of foreshadowing and build up is incredible. I don't have too much more to add. This was the series
            that got me into Fantasy. How could I not love it?
        </p>
        <h4><i>The Expanse</i></h4>
        <p>
            Note: The Expanse doesn’t really fit under the category of “Generational” in the same way as the others on this list (all of the books form 1 series, without any real "subseries"), but it does follow the same characters for a number of years and ultimately it gives me a lot of similar vibes as the previous series in this section. So I’m including it here for the vibes.

        <h5>The Premise</h5>
        <blockquote class="breakout full-width">
Humanity has colonized the solar system—Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond—but the stars are still out of our reach.

Jim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, the Scopuli, they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for—and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.

Detective Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but her parents have money and money talks. When the trail leads him to the Scopuli and rebel sympathizer Holden, he realizes that this girl may be the key to everything.

Holden and Miller must thread the needle between the Earth government, the Outer Planet revolutionaries, and secretive corporations—and the odds are against them. But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one small ship can change the fate of the universe.

        <h5>The Pitch</h5>
        <p>
	In no other sci-fi series have I continually thought to myself, “This is our future.” The Expanse is an incredibly relevant and exciting sci-fi series that follows James Holden and his crew as they end up at the center of the biggest conspiracy the Solar System has ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
	The world is set roughly 300 years in the future. Humanity has colonized the solar system, but anything further is out of our reach. Society is split along planetary lines: Earthers, Martians, and Belters—the poor and scattered people oft abused by the capitalist machines of the inner planets. Much thought has been put into the world and the societal dynamics that exist, and it just makes so much sense that you can’t help but feel that this is the world towards which we are headed.
        </p>
        <p>
	I don’t want to say too much more because I don’t want to spoil anything, but this series is probably objectively the best sci-fi series on this list that would appeal to the most people, even if I like the other ones just as much.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, the series was adapated into a very well make TV show, which can be a rarity in these parts. This is super cool because if you get
            hooked on the series you can get your friends who don't enjoy reading as much to also fall in love with the series.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still prefer the books over the TV show for two main reasons, however. First, they have not and probably won't adapt the final three books. And second, 
            one of the actors got involved in a sexual misconduct scandal (rightfully so) which caused some stark deviations from the book plots.
            This isn't really the fault of the showrunners as they handled it as well as they could have, but it does make me a little sad to think about
            what could have been.

        <h3>Ratings</h3>
        <p>
Note that the difference here between any of these is already super minor. This is already the S tier. Also I wouldn’t use this to determine what you should read. This is highly tuned to my preferences and current state of mind. You should pick what sounds the most interesting to you yourself.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            All in all, you can't really go wrong with any of these series. 
            And there are also many series which I have not read! So if you have any suggestions for me I'm always interested
            to get them. I have various socials and emails linked at the bottom of the home page of this website.

            or may not be out of date.

        <p>To send it off, here are some last honorable mentions for series and books that I've also read and would recommend, but just did't include
            on the list for various reasons.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><i>The Gentleman Bastards Series</i> by Scott Lynch (famously unfinished, but it could be resumed soon according to statements from the author)</li>
            <li><i>The Kingkiller Chronicle</i> by Patrick Rothfuss (another famously unfinished series; has some of my favorite prose)</li>
            <li><i>Babel</i> by R.K. Kuang (a very well made alternate history/fantasy standalone novel that tackles imperialism)</li>
            <li><i>The Teixcalaan Series</i> (very unique Sci-Fi series of 2 books also focused on cultural imperialism)</li>
            <li><i class="cosmere">Tress of the Emerald Sea</i> (Cosmere standalone; also a potential good start to the Cosmere)</li>
            <li><i class="cosmere">Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</i> (Cosmere standalone; also a potential good start to the Cosmere)</li>
