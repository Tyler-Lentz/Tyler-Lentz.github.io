        <h1>My Favorite Quotes from Fantasy/Sci-fi</h1>

        <p>
            Fantasy and sci-fi, or <span class="highlight">speculative fiction</span>, are genres which at their
            core are defined by their settings. It is ironic then, that the least important part of speculative fiction 
            is generally setting. Sure, the setting of a particular book or series might be what gets you interested 
            in it the first place (e.g. "I want to read medieval fantasy, like Game of Thrones!"), but once you've 
            entered that world, for most people it doesn't matter how interesting the setting is if the characters 
            and/or plot are terrible.
        </p>

        <p>
            If setting is relatively less important, then why write speculative fiction at all? Why don't all authors
            just write grounded stories set in the real world, with real characters you might find in your own
            neighborhood. Surely these kinds of stories would provide more relevant observations about the real world
            and the human condition?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, I just said a rhetorical question in the introduction of a blog post, so that basically guarantees
            that the premise is competely bogus, and is probably something no sane person would ever think.
            But let's dive into it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            First, fantastical settings are just cool. They can greatly enhance the entertainment of a work if 
            done well, and for those of us looking for stories that provide a sense of magic or wonder, then
            it isn't really a puzzle why we care about setting.
        </p>

        <p>
            But second, and more importantly, a great setting can provide something that more literary, or grounded,
            fiction cannot. <span class="highlight">Fantasical,or otherwise foreign, settings can make observations
            about the real world that wouldn't be possible otherwise.</span> In other words, by creating an alternate
            world that is <em>slightly</em> different than our own, the author can draw parallels and make 
            connections that give more insight into what makes us human.
        </p>

        <p>
            So although setting is less important than plot and character in making a good story, in speculative fiction 
            a great setting can provide the framework to make insights that would only be possible in some other,
            fantastical world. So the least important part of a good story becomes the most integral part of
            an amazing work of fantasy.
        </p>

            With this in mind, I have some of my favorite quotes from fantasy and sci-fi to share here. All
            of these, when I read them, made me stop and think for a moment at how profound they were.
